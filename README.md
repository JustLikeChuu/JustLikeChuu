  - **Undergraduate**: Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science and Design (CSD)**.
  - Previously graduated with a **Diploma in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics**.

- 🌱 **My Goal**:  
  With technology becoming increasingly prevalent, the risks associated with it grow more complex and rampant. I aspire to leverage my skills and knowledge to make **cyberspace safer for everyone**.

## 🐍 Notable Projects
- **RPA Integrated RTA** (Apr 2021 – Jun 2021):
  - Designed and improved **Red Team Automation (RTA)** scripts to simulate security breaches.
  - Built and modified **9 automated Python scripts** for process automation.
  - Developed a Flask-based **web GUI** for user-friendly script execution.
  - Explored applications of **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** to complement security operations.

- **DTI - Sprout Sprinters** (Feb 2025 - May 2025)
  - An interactive wellness solution designed for SUTD administrative staff to reduce stress and encourage physical activity during work hours.
  - Combining a smart fidget toy with a Unity-based AR mobile app, the system promotes movement and mindfulness through gamified feedback and calming virtual environments.
  - **Core Features**
    - **Fidget Keychain**
      - Step Tracker: Built-in accelerometer tracks steps; movement earns points in the app.
      - Stress Detection: Tactile inputs (joystick, buttons, scroll wheel) provide sensory relief and indicate stress levels.
      - Break Reminders: Prolonged interaction triggers a gentle buzz, prompting users to take a walking break.
    - **Unity Mobile App**
      - Health Dashboard: Real-time sync with the keychain via Arduino + Firebase to display steps and stress activity.
      - AR Garden: Users scan their workspace to place and customize a relaxing virtual garden that evolves with daily activity.
      - Plant Shop: Points from walking can be exchanged for virtual plants, gamifying movement and rewarding consistency.
  - **Tech Stack**
    - Hardware: Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, Accelerometer, Joystick, Buttons
    - Software: Unity (C#), AR Foundation, Firebase, Arduino IDE
    - Platform: Android Mobile App
